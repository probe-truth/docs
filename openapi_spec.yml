    # Introduction
    
    Deeptect is a product that uses patented technology for the detection of Audio, Audiovisual, and Visual deepfakes.
    
    ## Usage
    
    Deeptect is available as a web app plus API. The web app can be used like a normal website. 
    The API is for programmatic usage, e.g for integrating into existing enterprise applications. 
    
    ### Authentication
    
    *webportal* Standard username/password based auth.
    
    *API* The /login endpoint is used to fetch a JWT token that is used in subsequent API calls. 
    The username/password are passed in the body of the request.
    
    
    ### Login Example
    <details>
      <summary> Login Python Example Code</summary>
      ```python
          import json
          import requests 
          
          endpoint = "https://7biv2ac9kd.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/login"
          username = os.environ['username']  # or other mechanisms for getting the username
          password = os.environ['password']  # or other mechanisms for getting the password
          
          body = json.dumps({"username": username, "password": password})
          
          login_response = requests.post(endpoint, data=body)
          if login_response.status_code == 200:
            print("Successfully authenticated") 
            jwt_token = login_response.json()['access_token']
            refresh_token = login_response.json()['refresh_token']
          else:
            # gracefully handle failures in your application e.g with retries/etc 
            print(f"Login failed: status code {login_response.status_code} :: {login_response.text})
      ```    
    </details>
    
        
    ### Uploading a file
    
    The API supports large file uploads by using presigned URLs. The process starts with a request to the 
    /uploads endpoint with the request body containing the "filename". The server returns a presigned URL 
    that is then used in subsequent operations. Example code using python is provided below. 
    <details>
      <summary>File Upload Python Example Code</summary>
    ```python
        import json
        import requests  # install requests package
        
        api_endpoint = "placeholder"
        jwt_token = "placeholder"  # add the jwt_token, either through environment variables or other mechanisms
        auth_header = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {jwt_token}"}
        filename = "placeholder.wav"
        upload_request_body = json.dumps({"filename": filename})  # specify the filename of the upload
        
        presigned_url_response = requests.post(api_endpoint + "/uploads", data=upload_request_body, headers=auth_header)
        if presigned_url_response.status_code == 200:
            # Sucessfully retrieved pre-signed URL
            response_json = presigned_url_response.json()
            unique_upload_id = response_json["upload_id"]
            presign_info = presigned_url_response.json()["presignResponse"]
            presigned_url = presign_info["url"]
            fields = presign_info["fields"]
            with open(filename, "rb") as f:
                files = {"file": (fields["key"], f)}
                upload_response = requests.post(presigned_url, data=fields, files=files)
                if upload_response.status_code == 204:
                    # successfully uploaded the file
                    print("Success. File has been uploaded")
                    print(f"Unique id (keep for your records): {unique_upload_id}")
        else:
            # the status_code can be 401, 500, etc, handle it gracefully in your application
            raise Exception("Request to retrieve upload url failed")
    ```
